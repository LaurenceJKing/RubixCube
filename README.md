# RubixCube

This is my attempt at the Rubix Cube kata.

# To Do
- Figure out a way to test rotating the adjacent edges as well as the chosen face (propably using an xunit theory with class or member data)
- Figure out a way to rotate the adjacent edges as well as the chosen face.
- IO to print the Rubix Cube on the screen and to accept inputs.
